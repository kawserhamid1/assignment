                    <h3> Be committed </h3>
                    <p>
                        Through commitment, you can gain motivation to pursue success. You should make a list that
                        includes your goal, your level of commitment to the goal and what you're willing to do to
                        achieve that goal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Staying focused on your plan is crucial. It helps to put aside at least 15 minutes per day to
                        think about your plan and work toward it. This will keep your goal fresh in your mind and allow
                        you to continue focusing on it.

                    <h3>Learn from the journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rather than focusing strictly on the results of your accomplishments, take notice of the small
                        steps needed to achieve success. If you allow yourself to enjoy small victories along your
                        journey, reaching your goal will become a new adventure each day and you will be more likely to
                        stay on track. By doing this, you will learn new and exciting things along the way, which can
                        help you grow as a person.

                    <p>
                        Developing a positive mindset is all about trusting yourself and your ability to succeed. It's
                        important to replace any negative thoughts with positive ones to motivate yourself to keep
                        trying no matter what challenges come your way.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On your path to becoming successful, you're likely to learn new things and think differently
                        than before. Your goals will not happen overnight. They will take practice and discipline to
                        achieve, so it's vital to think about the process positively.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Stick to a schedule when working on your goals. Give yourself challenges according to your
                        personal calendar, such as "I will run a seven-minute mile by the end of the month," or "I will
                        save $5,000 by the end of the year."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Even if you do not achieve the goal, you will have your starting point in your calendar and will
                        see progress. If you plan your goals and track them in a calendar, you will always have proof of
                        your progress. Having something tangible is a great motivator to keep working toward success.
